Digital Down Conversion and Baseband Filtering (75 pts)
Download HW2.mat from Canvas and load data using ‘load HW2.mat’ in Matlab. Vector
‘sig_modulated_fixed’ contains the fixed point signal (i.e. mantissa values) of modulated human speech.
‘demod_Lo’ is the fixed point local oscillator signal (mantissa) to be used for demodulation. Both
‘sig_modulated_fixed’ and ‘demod_Lo’ are quantized with signed fixed point representation (10,9). Note
that these vectors are complex valued. ‘my_LPF’ stores the real-valued filter (LPF) coefficients which are
in floating point (not fixed point quantized).
